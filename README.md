## Usage

### Running the Notebook

1. **Start Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Open the main notebook**:
   Navigate to `Implementation_of_ANN_Using_Keras.ipynb`

3. **Run all cells**:
   Execute cells sequentially or run all cells at once

### Key Steps in the Implementation

1. **Data Import and Exploration**
   - Loading the dataset
   - Exploratory data analysis
   - Data visualization

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Data cleaning
   - Feature scaling/normalization
   - Train-test split

3. **Model Building**
   - Creating the ANN architecture
   - Defining layers and neurons
   - Setting activation functions

4. **Model Compilation**
   - Choosing optimizer
   - Defining loss function
   - Setting evaluation metrics

5. **Model Training**
   - Fitting the model
   - Monitoring training progress
   - Validation during training

6. **Model Evaluation**
   - Performance metrics
   - Confusion matrix
   - Visualization of results

## Model Architecture

The ANN implementation typically includes:

- **Input Layer**: Matches the number of input features
- **Hidden Layers**: One or more fully connected layers with ReLU activation
- **Output Layer**: Depends on the classification problem (sigmoid for binary, softmax for multi-class)
- **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer for efficient training
- **Loss Function**: Binary crossentropy or categorical crossentropy

### Example Architecture

```python
model = Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(n_features,)),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    Dense(n_classes, activation='softmax')  # or sigmoid for binary
])
```
